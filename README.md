🌐 My Portfolio

Crafting clean, precise, and modern digital experiences.

Hi, I’m a 21-year-old creator with a background in mechanical engineering and automation.
I combine technical precision with creative problem-solving to build digital experiences that are efficient, minimal, and high-performance.

My journey into coding began through multiple courses and certifications, which fueled my passion for development and clean design.

 What I Believe In
	•	Functionality meets minimalism
	•	Precision in both engineering and code
	•	Performance over complexity

 When I’m Not Building
I’m probably analyzing charts, going for walks, or playing the guitar to stay inspired.
