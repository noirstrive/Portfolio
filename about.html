  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a 21-year-old creator with a background in
    <strong>mechanical engineering and automation</strong>. Alongside my
    technical education, I’ve completed several coding courses and
    certifications, which sparked my passion for building efficient and modern
    digital experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    My focus lies in <strong>precision, performance, and simplicity</strong>—
    whether in engineering or development. I believe great design combines
    functionality with minimalism.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of work, I spend my time <strong>analyzing charts</strong>,
    <strong>walking</strong>, or <strong>playing the guitar</strong> to recharge
    and stay inspired.
